# SocketIO

Socket.IO is a library that enables **low-latency**, **bidirectional** and **event-based** communication between a client and a server.

It is built on top of the [**WebSocket**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.

# Socket.IO

Socket.IO is a library that enables **low-latency**, **bidirectional** and **event-based** communication between a client and a server.

It is built on top of the [**WebSocket**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.

# FastAPI

**Documentation**: <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com" target="_blank">https://fastapi.tiangolo.com</a>

**Source Code**: <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi</a>


FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.
